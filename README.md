# intoduction:-
             now, in a data-driven world, accurate price prediction has become a critical tool for decision-making across various industries. whether estimating the value of real estate properties, forecasting stock prices, or determining product prices in e-commerce. price prediction models informed decisions based on reliable data insights.

# define problem statement:-
            traditional methods of price estimation are prone to errors and inefficiencies, particularly when dealing with large datasets or rapidly changing market conditions. this project uses machine learning techniques to overcome these limitations to develop a more accurate and scalable price prediction model.

# objective:-
            the objective of this project is to build a machine-learning model that predicts prices with high accuracy based on historical and contextual data. by advanced algorithms and data processing technique, this model aims to provide reliable price predictions that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
            
# build a machine learning model for our project:-
             1. understand the business problem
             2. business problem-related data is required
             3. collect data and data preprocessing
                        - handling missing values
                        - feature scaling or normalization
                        - encoding categorical data
             4. exploratory data analysis(EDA)
                         - find the top ten high-mobile price 
                         - find the top ten low mobile price
                         -  visualizations like scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts by using dataset features
                         -  create total sale reports of every mobile sale company.
             5. our problem statement related to choosing different models and compare to accuracy each other
             6. find the best model and evaluate it
             7. find the best model and testing done, which is predicted to be accurate for mobile sale price.
